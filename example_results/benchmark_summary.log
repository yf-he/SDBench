PARETO FRONTIER ANALYSIS
========================

The Pareto frontier for cost vs accuracy trade-offs includes:

1. ConservativeDiagnosticAgent (100% accuracy, $325 avg cost)
   - Most cost-effective approach
   - Relies on thorough history-taking
   - Minimal but targeted testing

2. LLMDiagnosticAgent (100% accuracy, $1,618 avg cost)
   - Highest accuracy with comprehensive workup
   - More expensive but thorough
   - Faster diagnosis (fewer actions)

The RandomDiagnosticAgent falls below the Pareto frontier due to poor performance.

CLINICAL REASONING ANALYSIS
===========================

ConservativeDiagnosticAgent Strengths:
- Excellent history-taking approach
- Cost-effective diagnostic strategy
- Appropriate use of basic laboratory tests
- Good pattern recognition

ConservativeDiagnosticAgent Weaknesses:
- Minor incompleteness in diagnostic specificity
- Could benefit from more targeted testing

LLMDiagnosticAgent Strengths:
- Superior diagnostic accuracy
- Comprehensive and appropriate test selection
- Excellent clinical reasoning
- Faster diagnosis

LLMDiagnosticAgent Weaknesses:
- Higher cost due to extensive testing
- May order unnecessary tests in some cases

RandomDiagnosticAgent Weaknesses:
- No clinical reasoning
- Inappropriate test selection
- Failed to make any diagnoses
- High cost with no benefit

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
